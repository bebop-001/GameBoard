# GameBoard
Android Kotlin implementation of Game-2048 and Game-15.

This is an Android user interface for code that was developed during
during Coursera's "Kotlin for Java Developers" and not the actual
game code.

The Coursera course was excellent by the way and I highly recommend
it for anyone with experience in Java who wants to transition to 
Kotlin.  If you're and Android developer, this language is probably
a good idea since it's pretty obvious Google is pushing in that
direction.

At some point I plan on posting this app on Google Play as an 
open-source app -- but it's not ready for that yet.
